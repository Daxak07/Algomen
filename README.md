# SHORTEST PATH by Algomen

## REAL-LIFE GRAPHS
*Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges.*

**EVERYTHING IN OUR WORLD IS LINKED:**
* All cities are linked by roads
* Pages are linked by hyperlinks on the internet
* Flight and rail network
* Mobile network
* Components of Electric circuit
* Components of computer chips and etc…

*By graphs, we can simulate all these networks to make some visual analysis like finding connections and shortest paths between nodes.*

## Algorithm
**What is Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm?**

* Dijkstra algorithm is a greedy algorithm.
* It finds a shortest path tree for a weighted undirected graph.
* This means it finds a shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks
* For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between source node and every other node.
* This algorithm also used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.
* Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm. In Prim’s algorithm we create minimum spanning tree (MST) and in Dijkstra algorithm we create shortest path tree (SPT) from the given source...

**What is Bellman-Ford’s shortest path algorithm?**

* THE BELLMAN-FORD ALGORITHM IS A GRAPH SEARCH ALGORITHM THAT FINDS THE SHORTEST PATH
BETWEEN A GIVEN SOURCE VERTEX AND ALL OTHER VERTICES IN THE GRAPH. THIS ALGORITHM CAN BE
USED ON BOTH WEIGHTED AND UNWEIGHTED GRAPHS.
* LIKE DIJKSTRA'S SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM, THE BELLMAN-FORD ALGORITHM IS GUARANTEED TO FIND
THE SHORTEST PATH IN A GRAPH. THOUGH IT IS SLOWER THAN DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM, BELLMAN-FORD
IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING GRAPHS THAT CONTAIN NEGATIVE EDGE WEIGHTS, SO IT IS MORE VERSATILE.
* IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IF THERE EXISTS A NEGATIVE CYCLE IN THE GRAPH, THEN THERE IS NO
SHORTEST PATH. GOING AROUND THE NEGATIVE CYCLE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TIMES WOULD CONTINUE
TO DECREASE THE COST OF THE PATH (EVEN THOUGH THE PATH LENGTH IS INCREASING). BECAUSE OF
THIS, BELLMAN-FORD CAN ALSO DETECT NEGATIVE CYCLES WHICH IS A USEFUL FEATURE.

## Shortest path Applications

### Games 
What about uses of the shortest path algorithms, the very first thing that came to our mind was the project we worked on in the java2 course.

### Map services 
Shortest path algorithms are applied to automatically find directions between physical locations, such as driving directions on web mapping websites like MapQuest or Google Maps.

### Nondeterministic machine
If one represents a nondeterministic abstract machine as a graph where vertices describe states and edges describe possible transitions, shortest path algorithms can be used to find an optimal sequence of choices to reach a certain goal state, or to establish lower bounds on the time needed to reach a given state.
